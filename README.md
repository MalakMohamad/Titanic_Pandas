**Overview **
- The dataset used was taken from kaggle 'Titanic' dataset. The project mainly focuses on data cleaning and data preprocessing using python and pandas (python's library). 
The aim of this project is to prepare the dataset for training or analysis in future. 
**Technologies used **
- Python (base language)
- Pandas (library)
- JupyterNotebook (notebook interactive)
**Project Steps**
1. Data loading, reading and exploring
-I have used pandas functions to load the dataset into the interactive environment (notebook)
-I have provided a small statistics insight through info() and describe() methods
2. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing data in the given attributes where i imputed mean of column 'Age'
- Dropping irrelevant attribute column such as 'Cabin' due to high missing value rate
- Filling 'Embarked' column with values
3. Feature Engineering
- Created new columns 'FamilySize' and 'IsAlone'
4. Data Visualization (Planned)  
- Data visualization will be performed in the future to better understand patterns and relationships.
  
**Dataset **
The dataset is available from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
